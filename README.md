# ascendhook visual troll

this is purely visual. nothing works, it's simply for trolling. 
though i do beileve the original program is a rat itself, be careful.

1. make sure you have **glfw** and **imgui** installed. you can install it via pip:
   ```bash
   pip install glfw
   pip install imgui

you might need to download visual studio and install the Desktop development with C++ to build the imgui library.
